# Introduction

This template is based on the Overleaf template provided by the Biphysical Journal:
<https://www.overleaf.com/articles/biophysical%E2%80%90journaltemplate/pxxcptphxdhv>
Your introduction goes here!
Some examples of commonly used commands and features are listed below, to help you get started.
Leave a blank line between blocks of text to start a new paragraph.
Abbreviations should be defined in the text at first mention.

We are using [@quarto].

Please also take note of the `\section*{...}` titles in this template:
they are the required sections in a regular research Article manuscript.



In particular, the main text of regular Articles and Computational Tools manuscripts must be structured with the following sections:
**Introduction**, **Materials and Methods**, **Results**, **Discussion
(or Results and Discussion)**, **Conclusion**.

Theoretical manuscripts may include just a **Methods** section and do not require **Materials**.

No particular organization structure is required for Letters.

If your manuscript is accepted, the Biophysical production team will re-format the references for publication.
*It is not necessary to format the reference list yourself to mirror the final published form.*

# Materials and Methods

Capitalize trade names and give manufacturers' full names and addresses
(city and state).

## Sectioning commands

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, qui minim labore adipisicing minim sint cillum sint consectetur cupidatat.


# Results


See @tbl-numbers.

LaTeX is great at typesetting mathematics:

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically
distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and
$\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
$$
S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i
$${#eq-clt}
denote their mean.
Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge
in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.
Thus concludes the explanation about @eq-clt.

You can make lists with automatic numbering ...

...or bullet points ...

...or with words and descriptions ...

## Figures and Tables

Here is a table (or not, this is LaTeX, so it will put it wherever it wants. "Here" is very relative...).

|Thing   | Value  |
|:-------|-------:|
|A 42    |      18|
|B 15    |      18|
|C 34    |      17|
|D 99    |      24|
